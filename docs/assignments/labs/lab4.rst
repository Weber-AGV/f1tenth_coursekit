Lab 4 - Follow the Gap
===========================================

.. tip:: Before starting this lab, review the :ref:`Lecture 6 <doc_lecture06>` to ensure you are familiar with the material.

| **Goals:**
| In this lab, you will implement a reactive algorithm for obstacle avoidance. While the base starter code defines an implementation of the RoboRacer Follow the Gap Algorithm, you are allowed to submit in C++, and encouraged to try different reactive algorithms or a combination of several. In total, the python code for the algorithm is only about 120 lines.

| **Learning Outcomes:**
| The following fundamental should be understood by the students upon completion of this lab:

	* Reactive methods for obstacle avoidance

**Required Skills:** ROS, Python/C++

**Allotted Time:** 1 week

| **Repository:** `Github Repository <https://github.com/Weber-AGV/f1tenth_lab4_template>`_

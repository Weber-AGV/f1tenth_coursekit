Calibrating the Odometry
========================

.. note::

   This section assumes that you have already completed
   :ref:`doc_build_car`,
   :ref:`doc_software_setup`,
   :ref:`doc_build_car_firmware`,
   and :ref:`drive_manualcontrol`.

One final step that is crucial to get an accurate estimate of the car's
current velocity, and accurate localization and mapping later on, is to
calibrate the odometry estimation. On the RoboRacer vehicle, the odometry
is estimated from the motor's ERPM and the current angle of the servo.

Required Equipment
==================

- Fully built RoboRacer vehicle
- Pit/Host computer
- Joystick
- Tape measure
- Tape


Calibrating the Steering and Odometry
=====================================

Now that everything is built, configured, and installed, the odometry of
the vehicle needs to be calibrated. The VESC receives input velocities in
m/s and steering angles in radians. However, the motor and servo require
commands in revolutions per minute (RPM) and servo positions. The
conversion parameters will need to be tuned to your specific car.

1. The parameters in ``vesc.yaml`` need to be calibrated. This YAML file
   is located at:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $HOME/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/config/vesc.yaml


Preparing for Calibration
=========================

.. note::

   Before starting, ensure you've **lifted the car up with a pit stand or a
   box** so the wheels can spin freely.


Checking Motor Rotation Direction
=================================

1. **Verify Motor Rotation**

   If, when given a **positive velocity** (or moving forward with the
   joystick), the motor spins in the reverse direction, **swap 2 of the 3
   connections** from the VESC to the BLDC motor.

   .. important::

      Before doing this, **disconnect the battery** from the VESC.

2. **Check VESC Driver Interpretation**

   After launching teleop with the bringup launch, echo the ``/odom``
   topic in a new bash window inside the container:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 topic echo --no-arr /odom

Tuning the Particle Filter (localize.yaml)
============================================

The particle filter's behavior is controlled entirely by ``localize.yaml``. This page explains every parameter and highlights which ones you should tune to improve localization quality.

To edit the config:

.. code-block:: bash

   code ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/particle_filter/config/localize.yaml

After making changes, rebuild and re-source:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/f1tenth_ws
   colcon build --packages-select particle_filter
   source install/setup.bash

Topic Names
-----------

.. code-block:: yaml

   scan_topic: '/scan'
   odometry_topic: '/odom'

These must match the topics your robot publishes. On the standard F1TENTH stack:

- ``/scan`` — LiDAR data from the Hokuyo or RPLiDAR
- ``/odom`` — wheel odometry from the VESC

You should not need to change these unless your robot uses different topic names.

Particle Count
--------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   max_particles: 4000

The number of pose hypotheses the filter maintains. More particles means better accuracy but higher CPU cost.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Value
     - Pros
     - Cons
   * - 1000
     - Very fast, low CPU
     - May lose track in complex environments
   * - 4000 (default)
     - Good balance for Jetson Orin
     - Moderate CPU usage
   * - 8000+
     - Very robust localization
     - High CPU, may slow down update rate

**When to change:** If the filter frequently loses track (particles spread out and don't converge), try increasing this. If CPU usage is too high and localization is already stable, try decreasing it.

LiDAR Downsampling
------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   angle_step: 18

Takes every Nth LiDAR ray instead of using all ~1080. At ``angle_step: 18``, the filter uses about 60 rays per scan.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Value
     - Effect
   * - 6
     - ~180 rays — more accurate but significantly slower
   * - 18 (default)
     - ~60 rays — good balance
   * - 36
     - ~30 rays — very fast but less accurate in complex environments

**When to change:** If the filter is slow (low iterations per second), increase ``angle_step``. If the environment has many narrow features (doorways, pillars), decrease it for finer angular resolution.

Motion Model Dispersion
-----------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   motion_dispersion_x: 0.05
   motion_dispersion_y: 0.025
   motion_dispersion_theta: 0.25

These control how much random noise is added to each particle after applying odometry. They represent the standard deviation of Gaussian noise in meters (x, y) and radians (theta).

.. important::

   If the particle filter is not performing well, start here. ``motion_dispersion_theta`` is the parameter you will adjust most often:

- **Too low** — particles stay tightly clustered but can't recover from heading errors. The filter "locks on" to a wrong heading and diverges.
- **Too high** — particles spread too far, the cloud is always diffuse, and the pose estimate is noisy.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Symptom
     - Adjustment
   * - Filter diverges at speed
     - Increase ``motion_dispersion_theta`` (try 0.35–0.5)
   * - Filter diverges in turns
     - Increase ``motion_dispersion_theta``
   * - Pose estimate is jittery
     - Decrease ``motion_dispersion_theta`` (try 0.15–0.2)
   * - Filter drifts sideways
     - Increase ``motion_dispersion_y`` (try 0.05)

Sensor Model Weights
--------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   z_short: 0.01
   z_max: 0.07
   z_rand: 0.12
   z_hit: 0.75
   sigma_hit: 8.0

These four ``z_`` values control how the filter interprets differences between expected and actual LiDAR readings. They must sum to approximately 1.0 (they are normalized internally).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 45 40

   * - Parameter
     - What It Models
     - When to Adjust
   * - ``z_hit``
     - Measurement matches expected range (Gaussian)
     - Rarely — this should stay dominant (0.7–0.8)
   * - ``z_short``
     - Something blocked the beam early (person, furniture)
     - Increase in environments with many dynamic obstacles
   * - ``z_max``
     - LiDAR returned max range (no return)
     - Increase if your environment has glass or dark surfaces
   * - ``z_rand``
     - Random noise / multipath reflections
     - Increase in noisy or reflective environments

``sigma_hit`` controls the width of the Gaussian for ``z_hit``. A larger value is more tolerant of small map inaccuracies but less precise. The default of 8.0 works well for most indoor environments.

The defaults work well for most indoor environments. Only adjust these if you have a specific problem like many dynamic obstacles or a very reflective environment.

Squash Factor
-------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   squash_factor: 2.2

This prevents particle collapse — where one particle gets an astronomically high weight and all others are discarded. The weight of each particle is raised to the power of ``1/squash_factor``.

- **Higher values** (3.0+) — more diversity, filter is more exploratory but slower to converge
- **Lower values** (1.5) — less diversity, converges faster but more fragile
- **1.0** — no squashing (not recommended — filter will collapse)

**When to change:** If particles converge too aggressively and the filter "snaps" to wrong positions, increase this. If the particle cloud never tightens, decrease it.

Ray Casting Method
------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   range_method: 'rmgpu'
   rangelib_variant: 2
   theta_discretization: 112

``range_method`` selects the RangeLibc algorithm for simulating LiDAR:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 15 70

   * - Method
     - Speed
     - Notes
   * - ``rmgpu``
     - Fastest
     - GPU ray marching — use on Jetson Orin (requires CUDA)
   * - ``cddt``
     - Fast
     - CPU-only — best fallback if no CUDA
   * - ``pcddt``
     - Fast
     - Pruned CDDT variant
   * - ``rm``
     - Moderate
     - CPU ray marching, no precomputation
   * - ``bl``
     - Slowest
     - Bresenham's line — use only for debugging

``rangelib_variant`` selects the evaluation strategy:

- **2** — ``VAR_REPEAT_ANGLES_EVAL_SENSOR`` — best for ``rmgpu`` (default)
- **3** — ``VAR_REPEAT_ANGLES_EVAL_SENSOR_ONE_SHOT`` — does NOT work with ``rmgpu``
- **4** — ``VAR_RADIAL_CDDT_OPTIMIZATIONS`` — only works with ``cddt``/``pcddt``

**For the Jetson Orin, use** ``rmgpu`` **with** ``rangelib_variant: 2``. If you see CUDA errors, switch to ``cddt`` with ``rangelib_variant: 4``.

``theta_discretization`` controls angular resolution for methods that precompute angles. The default of 112 works well and rarely needs changing.

Other Settings
--------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   max_range: 10
   viz: 1
   max_viz_particles: 60
   fine_timing: 0
   publish_odom: 1

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``max_range``
     - Maximum LiDAR range in meters. Readings beyond this are clipped. Match your LiDAR's spec.
   * - ``viz``
     - Enable (1) or disable (0) visualization topics. Disable for maximum performance.
   * - ``max_viz_particles``
     - Number of particles sent to RViz2. Lower = less network overhead. Does not affect accuracy.
   * - ``fine_timing``
     - Enable (1) to print per-step timing breakdowns. Useful for profiling, noisy in normal use.
   * - ``publish_odom``
     - Enable (1) to publish ``/pf/pose/odom``. Must be 1 for pure pursuit or any node reading the pose.

Map Server Section
------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   map_server:
     ros__parameters:
       map: 'lab_map_clean'

This tells the launch file which map to load. The value is the map name **without the file extension** — it looks for ``<map_name>.yaml`` and ``<map_name>.pgm`` in the particle filter's own ``maps/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/particle_filter/maps/

The default map ``lab_map_clean`` is a pre-made map of the CAE lab that is ready to use. If this matches your environment, no changes are needed.

**Using your own map:** If you created a map with SLAM (see the SLAM tutorial), that map is stored in the **f1tenth_stack** maps directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/maps/

The particle filter cannot access maps from ``f1tenth_stack`` — you need to copy both the ``.pgm`` and ``.yaml`` files into the particle filter's ``maps/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/maps/hallway_map.pgm \
      ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/particle_filter/maps/

   cp ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/maps/hallway_map.yaml \
      ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/particle_filter/maps/

Then update ``localize.yaml`` to point to your map:

.. code-block:: yaml

   map_server:
     ros__parameters:
       map: 'hallway_map'

After changing the map, rebuild so the new files are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/f1tenth_ws
   colcon build --packages-select particle_filter
   source install/setup.bash

Recommended Starting Points for Tuning
---------------------------------------

If you are having trouble with localization, try these changes in order:

1. **Re-set the initial pose** — click 2D Pose Estimate accurately in RViz2
2. **Increase** ``motion_dispersion_theta`` — try 0.35, then 0.5
3. **Increase** ``max_particles`` — try 6000 or 8000
4. **Decrease** ``angle_step`` — try 12 for more LiDAR rays
5. **Check** ``odometry_topic`` — make sure it matches your robot's odometry topic name

After each change, rebuild with ``colcon build --packages-select particle_filter`` and relaunch.

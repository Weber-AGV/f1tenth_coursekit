Running Pure Pursuit
=====================

Once waypoints are recorded, the pure pursuit node can drive the car autonomously around the track using the particle filter for localization.

How It Works
------------

Pure Pursuit is a geometric path tracking algorithm. On each update:

1. The node reads the car's current pose from ``/pf/pose/odom``
2. It finds the **lookahead point** — a point on the path a fixed distance ahead of the car
3. It computes the steering angle to arc toward that lookahead point
4. It publishes drive commands on ``/drive``

The lookahead distance controls the trade-off between tracking accuracy and smoothness. A shorter lookahead follows the path more tightly; a longer lookahead produces smoother but wider turns.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Waypoints recorded (see :ref:`doc_tutorials_waypoint_recording`)
- ``bringup`` running (Terminal 1)
- ``ros2 launch particle_filter localize_launch.py`` running (Terminal 2)
- Initial pose set in RViz2

Steps
-----

1️⃣ Launch Pure Pursuit (Terminal 3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/f1tenth_ws
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch pure_pursuit pure_pursuit_launch.py

The car will begin following the recorded waypoints and loop the track continuously.

2️⃣ Visualize in RViz2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a **Path** display in RViz2 to see the recorded waypoints overlaid on the map:

- Click **Add** → select **Path**
- Set Topic to ``/pure_pursuit/path``

The car's progress along the path will update in real time.

Key Parameters
--------------

Tune pure pursuit performance by editing the config file:

.. code-block:: bash

   nano ~/f1tenth_ws/src/pure_pursuit/config/pure_pursuit.yaml

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 15 55

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``lookahead_distance``
     - ``1.5``
     - Distance ahead on the path to steer toward (meters) — increase for smoother driving at speed
   * - ``speed``
     - ``1.0``
     - Forward drive speed (m/s)
   * - ``waypoint_file``
     - ``waypoints.csv``
     - Path to the recorded waypoints CSV

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Problem
     - Solution
   * - Car immediately stops or spins
     - Initial pose not set — set 2D Pose Estimate in RViz2 and re-launch
   * - Car cuts corners aggressively
     - Decrease ``lookahead_distance``
   * - Car oscillates side to side
     - Increase ``lookahead_distance``; reduce speed
   * - Car drifts off path over time
     - Particle filter may have diverged — re-set initial pose in RViz2
   * - No waypoints file found
     - Re-run waypoint recording; confirm path in ``pure_pursuit.yaml``

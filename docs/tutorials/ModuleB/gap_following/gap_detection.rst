Gap Detection
=============

Follow The Gap - Step-by-Step Breakdown
----------------------------------------

In Follow-The-Gap (FTG) obstacle avoidance, we find the safest direction for the vehicle to steer based on LiDAR data. Here's the precise step-by-step breakdown for implementing FTG:

Step 1: Find the Closest Obstacle and Create a Safety Bubble
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Identify the **closest LiDAR point** (minimum distance in the LiDAR scan).
- Create a **safety bubble** around this obstacle.
- Flatten (set to zero) all points inside the bubble. These points are now considered obstacles.

.. note::

   **Why?** We take a pessimistic view by assuming the nearest obstacle is the biggest threat and blocking a region around it.

Step 2: Find the Maximum Gap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- After masking the bubble, all **nonzero ranges** represent safe, free space.
- Find the **longest sequence** of consecutive nonzero points.
- This sequence is the **largest safe gap** the vehicle can steer into.

Step 3: Pick the Best Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Choose the **midpoint** of the maximum gap as the best point to steer toward.
- Later, you can use more advanced methods to pick slightly to the left or right depending on the goal, but midpoint is simple and effective.

Example Code for Step 1 and Step 2
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def find_max_gap(self, free_space_ranges, bubble_radius=0.5):
       """
       Find the largest navigable gap after masking a safety bubble around closest obstacle.

       Args:
           free_space_ranges (np.array): Cleaned LiDAR ranges
           bubble_radius (float): Radius around obstacle to zero out (meters)

       Returns:
           (start_idx, end_idx): indices of the largest gap
       """
       # Step 1: Find the closest obstacle by taking the index of the minimum value in the ranges
       closest_idx = np.argmin(free_space_ranges)

       # Step 2: Create the safety bubble
       # Calculate how many LiDAR points the bubble covers based on bubble radius and angle increment
       angle_increment = self.angle_increment  # Assume you store angle_increment when node starts
       num_bubble_points = int(bubble_radius / angle_increment)

       # Calculate the start and end indices for the bubble, ensuring they stay within valid bounds
       start_bubble_idx = max(0, closest_idx - num_bubble_points)
       end_bubble_idx = min(len(free_space_ranges) - 1, closest_idx + num_bubble_points)

       # Flatten the safety bubble: set all points within the bubble to 0 (obstacle)
       free_space_ranges[start_bubble_idx:end_bubble_idx + 1] = 0.0

       # Step 3: Find the maximum consecutive non-zero gap
       max_gap_size = 0
       max_start_idx = 0
       max_end_idx = 0

       current_start = None  # Tracks the start index of the current free space sequence

       # Loop through each point in the LiDAR scan
       for i, distance in enumerate(free_space_ranges):
           if distance > 0:
               # If we find free space and haven't started a sequence, start one
               if current_start is None:
                   current_start = i
           else:
               # If we hit an obstacle, check if the previous free space sequence was the longest
               if current_start is not None:
                   gap_size = i - current_start
                   if gap_size > max_gap_size:
                       max_gap_size = gap_size
                       max_start_idx = current_start
                       max_end_idx = i - 1
                   current_start = None  # Reset sequence

       # Handle edge case: if the scan ends while we are still in a free space sequence
       if current_start is not None:
           gap_size = len(free_space_ranges) - current_start
           if gap_size > max_gap_size:
               max_start_idx = current_start
               max_end_idx = len(free_space_ranges) - 1

       return max_start_idx, max_end_idx

Key Points to Remember
----------------------

- The car width is **12 inches = 0.3048 meters**.
- You can adjust the ``bubble_radius`` based on your car's size and safety margin.
- A larger bubble will avoid tighter gaps but may limit navigation in narrow environments.

Next Step
---------

- After finding the maximum gap, we will implement a ``find_best_point()`` function to select the **steering target**.

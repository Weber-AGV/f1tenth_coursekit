Create ``turtlesim_ws`` Workspace
==================================

The following steps guide you to create a ROS 2 workspace named ``turtlesim_ws`` and include the ``turtlesim`` package for running a simple simulation.

1️⃣ Set Up the Workspace Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a terminal and create the workspace directory structure:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p ~/turtlesim_ws/src
   cd ~/turtlesim_ws

2️⃣ Add the turtlesim Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``turtlesim`` package is part of the ROS 2 distribution and can be cloned or installed directly.

Install Using apt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For most ROS 2 distributions, you can install ``turtlesim``:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim

This installs the turtlesim package system-wide on your machine.

.. note::

   No change to the structure of the ``turtlesim_ws`` workspace

3️⃣ Build the Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to the workspace root directory and build the packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/turtlesim_ws
   colcon build

.. image:: img/colcon_build.png
   :alt: colcon build
   :align: center

|

.. note::

   **What Does colcon build Do?**

   The ``colcon build`` command is used to build all the packages in a ROS 2 workspace. It automates the build process by managing dependencies, generating build artifacts, and installing outputs.

   **Initialize the Build Process**: Colcon identifies the workspace by finding the ``src/`` directory containing ROS 2 packages, then scans the directory to locate all ROS 2 packages (defined by ``package.xml`` files).

   **Dependency Analysis**: Colcon examines the dependencies of each package based on its ``package.xml`` file and builds a dependency graph. Packages are built in an order that satisfies their dependencies.

   **Invoke Build Systems**: Colcon identifies the build system used by each package (e.g., CMake for C++, setuptools for Python) and builds packages in parallel when there are no dependency conflicts.

   **Generate Build Artifacts**: The ``build/`` directory contains intermediate build files; the ``install/`` directory stores final outputs (executables, libraries, modules); and the ``log/`` directory captures build logs.

   **Environment Setup**: Colcon generates setup files (``setup.bash``, ``setup.zsh``, ``local_setup.bash``) in the ``install/`` directory to allow workspace packages to be sourced and used.

   **Post-Build Steps**: Colcon validates the build process and provides logs if packages fail to build, skipping dependent packages to prevent cascading failures.

   **Key Features**: Modular builds (each package built independently), incremental builds (only modified packages rebuilt), and build profiles (Debug, Release).

   **Common Command Options**:

   - ``--packages-select <package_name>``: Build only specified packages.
   - ``--packages-ignore <package_name>``: Skip specific packages during the build.
   - ``--parallel-workers <N>``: Control the number of parallel build jobs.
   - ``--event-handlers console_cohesion+``: Improve the console output format for better readability.

   By using ``colcon build``, you automate the process of compiling and installing your ROS 2 packages, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the workspace is ready for use.

4️⃣ Source the Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the build is complete, source the workspace to use the installed packages:

.. note::

   We don't currently have a package for this workspace yet. We will be creating one shortly.

.. code-block:: bash

   source ~/turtlesim_ws/install/setup.bash

To make this permanent, add it to your ``.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo "source ~/turtlesim_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

5️⃣ Understanding ROS 2 Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is a Workspace?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ROS 2 workspace is a directory structure used to organize and manage ROS 2 packages. It serves as the development environment where you store, build, and work with packages that are part of your ROS 2 project. A workspace includes several directories and components, each with a specific purpose.

6️⃣ Understanding ROS 2 Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What Is a ROS 2 Package?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **ROS 2 package** is a modular unit of functionality in ROS 2 that contains everything needed to perform a specific task or provide a feature. Packages are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 applications and can include nodes, libraries, configuration files, launch files, and other resources.

Key Components of a ROS 2 Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. ``package.xml``:
   - Metadata file that describes the package (name, version, description, dependencies).
   - Used by build tools to resolve dependencies.

2. ``CMakeLists.txt``:
   - Build configuration file for C++ or other compiled packages.
   - Specifies how the package should be built.

3. ``setup.py``:
   - Python build script for Python-based packages.

4. Source Code:
   - Python scripts, C++ source files, or libraries implementing the package functionality.
   - Typically placed in a directory named after the package.

5. Resources:
   - Configuration files, message/service/action definitions, launch files, etc., necessary for the package's operation.

What Makes a Package Special in ROS 2?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Reusability**:
   - Packages are self-contained, making it easy to share and reuse them across different projects.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Packages declare their dependencies in ``package.xml``, allowing tools like ``colcon`` to ensure everything needed is installed and built.

3. **Interoperability**:
   - ROS 2 packages can communicate with each other using topics, services, and actions, enabling modular system design.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Complex applications can be developed by combining multiple smaller, focused packages.

How a Package Fits Into a Workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A package resides in the ``src/`` directory of a ROS 2 workspace.
- It is built and installed into the workspace's ``build/`` and ``install/`` directories.
- After sourcing the workspace, the package's nodes, launch files, and resources become available for use.

Example Use Case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are controlling a robot, you might have:

- A **sensor package** to process sensor data.
- A **control package** to compute actions.
- A **simulation package** to visualize the robot's behavior.

Each package would handle one aspect of the overall application.

In essence, a ROS 2 package is a self-contained module that organizes code, dependencies, and resources for a specific purpose, allowing you to build scalable and modular robotic applications.

Summary
-------

You now have a functioning ROS 2 workspace with the turtlesim package installed. In the next section, we'll create a custom package to control the turtle.

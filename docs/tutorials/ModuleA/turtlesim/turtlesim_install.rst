Turtlesim Installation
======================

This guide walks you through installing and setting up turtlesim, a lightweight simulator for learning ROS 2 concepts.

1️⃣ Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

Turtlesim is a simple 2D simulator that comes with ROS 2. It provides a visual tool for learning ROS 2 concepts such as nodes, topics, services, and actions. The turtle can be controlled through various ROS 2 commands and is perfect for understanding the basics of robot control.

2️⃣ Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install turtlesim using apt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For ROS 2 Humble (or your specific ROS 2 distribution), install turtlesim with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim

.. note::

   Replace ``humble`` with your ROS 2 distribution name if you're using a different version (e.g., ``foxy``, ``galactic``).

Verify Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installation, verify that turtlesim is available:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 pkg list | grep turtlesim

You should see ``turtlesim`` listed in the output.

3️⃣ Use Turtlesim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start turtlesim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start the turtlesim simulator, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

The simulator window should appear, with a random turtle in the center.

In the terminal, under the command, you will see messages from the node:

.. code-block:: shell

   [INFO] [turtlesim]: Starting turtlesim with node name /turtlesim
   [INFO] [turtlesim]: Spawning turtle [turtle1] at x=[5.544445], y=[5.544445], theta=[0.000000]

There you can see the default turtle's name and the coordinates where it spawns.

Control the Turtle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a new terminal and source ROS 2 again:

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

Now you will run a new node to control the turtle in the first node:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

At this point you should have three windows open: a terminal running ``turtlesim_node``, a terminal running ``turtle_teleop_key`` and the ``turtlesim window``.

Arrange these windows so that you can see the turtlesim window, but also have the terminal running ``turtle_teleop_key`` active so that you can control the turtle in turtlesim.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the turtle. It will move around the screen, using its attached "pen" to draw the path it followed so far.

.. note::

   Pressing an arrow key will only cause the turtle to move a short distance and then stop. This is because, realistically, you wouldn't want a robot to continue carrying on an instruction if, for example, the operator lost the connection to the robot.

Explore ROS 2 Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see the nodes, and their associated topics, services, and actions, using the list subcommands of the respective commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 node list
   ros2 topic list
   ros2 service list
   ros2 action list

You will learn more about these concepts in the coming tutorials. Since the goal of this tutorial is only to get a general overview of turtlesim, you will use rqt to call some of the turtlesim services and interact with ``turtlesim_node``.

4️⃣ Install rqt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a new terminal to install ``rqt`` and its plugins:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ~nros-humble-rqt*

To run rqt:

.. code-block:: bash

   rqt

5️⃣ Use rqt
~~~~~~~~~~

When running rqt for the first time, the window will be blank. No worries; just select **Plugins > Services > Service Caller** from the menu bar at the top.

.. note::

   It may take some time for rqt to locate all the plugins. If you click on Plugins but don't see Services or any other options, you should close rqt and enter the command ``rqt --force-discover`` in your terminal.

Use the refresh button to the left of the Service dropdown list to ensure all the services of your turtlesim node are available.

Click on the Service dropdown list to see turtlesim's services, and select the ``/spawn`` service.

Try the spawn service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's use rqt to call the ``/spawn`` service. You can guess from its name that ``/spawn`` will create another turtle in the turtlesim window.

Give the new turtle a unique name, like ``turtle2``, by double-clicking between the empty single quotes in the **Expression** column. You can see that this expression corresponds to the value of **name** and is of type **string**.

Next enter some valid coordinates at which to spawn the new turtle, like ``x = 1.0`` and ``y = 1.0``.

.. image:: img/spawn.png
   :alt: spawn window
   :width: 70%

|

.. note::

   If you try to spawn a new turtle with the same name as an existing turtle, like the default ``turtle1``, you will get an error message in the terminal running ``turtlesim_node``:

   ``[ERROR] [turtlesim]: A turtle named [turtle1] already exists``

To spawn ``turtle2``, you then need to call the service by clicking the **Call** button on the upper right side of the rqt window.

If the service call was successful, you should see a new turtle (again with a random design) spawn at the coordinates you input for **x** and **y**.

If you refresh the service list in rqt, you will also see that now there are services related to the new turtle, ``/turtle2/...``, in addition to ``/turtle1/...``.

Try the set_pen service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's give ``turtle1`` a unique pen using the ``/set_pen`` service:

.. image:: img/set_pen.png
   :alt: set pen window
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

|

The values for **r**, **g** and **b**, which are between 0 and 255, set the color of the pen ``turtle1`` draws with, and **width** sets the thickness of the line.

To have ``turtle1`` draw with a distinct red line, change the value of **r** to 255, and the value of **width** to 5. Don't forget to call the service after updating the values.

If you return to the terminal where ``turtle_teleop_key`` is running and press the arrow keys, you will see ``turtle1``'s pen has changed.

.. image:: img/new_pen.png
   :alt: new pen window
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

|

You've probably also noticed that there's no way to move ``turtle2``. That's because there is no teleop node for ``turtle2``.

6️⃣ Remapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need a second teleop node in order to control ``turtle2``. However, if you try to run the same command as before, you will notice that this one also controls ``turtle1``. The way to change this behavior is by remapping the ``cmd_vel`` topic.

In a new terminal, source ROS 2, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key --ros-args --remap turtle1/cmd_vel:=turtle2/cmd_vel

Now, you can move ``turtle2`` when this terminal is active, and ``turtle1`` when the other terminal running ``turtle_teleop_key`` is active.

7️⃣ Close turtlesim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the simulation, you can enter ``Ctrl + C`` in the ``turtlesim_node`` terminal, and ``q`` in the ``turtle_teleop_key`` terminals.

Summary
-------

Using turtlesim and rqt is a great way to learn the core concepts of ROS 2.
